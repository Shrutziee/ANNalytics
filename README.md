<h1>Project Description: Predicting Customer Churn Using Artificial Neural Networks</h1>
        <p>This project aims to predict customer churn using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. Customer churn refers to customers who stop doing business with a company. The ability to accurately predict churn can help businesses proactively retain customers and improve their services. Here's a detailed description of the project:</p>
        
<h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The primary goal of this project is to build and evaluate an ANN to predict whether a customer will exit (churn) based on various features from the dataset.</p>
        
<h2>Dataset</h2>
        <p>The dataset used in this project is a customer churn dataset, which includes various features such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CreditScore:</strong> Customer's credit score.</li>
            <li><strong>Geography:</strong> Customer's country.</li>
            <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Customer's gender.</li>
            <li><strong>Age:</strong> Customer's age.</li>
            <li><strong>Tenure:</strong> Number of years the customer has been with the bank.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance:</strong> Customer's account balance.</li>
            <li><strong>NumOfProducts:</strong> Number of products the customer has with the bank.</li>
            <li><strong>HasCrCard:</strong> Whether the customer has a credit card.</li>
            <li><strong>IsActiveMember:</strong> Whether the customer is an active member.</li>
            <li><strong>EstimatedSalary:</strong> Customer's estimated salary.</li>
            <li><strong>Exited:</strong> Whether the customer has churned (1) or not (0).</li>
        </ul>
